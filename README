The function GetUNCPathOf  tries to find a UNC pathname for a given file by searching the 'net share' list.
If it fails, it returns the filename it was passed.

The map <localleader>yf  yanks the filename into "*  - the clipboard, for use in emails or browsers.

Useful for placing filenames into intranet emails.
